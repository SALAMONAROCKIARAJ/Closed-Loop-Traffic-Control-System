# Closed-Loop-Traffic-Control-System

Repository for 3 way closed loop traffic control system using Ultrasonic sensor

## About my work :
   Usually, the traffic system is open-loop but we can change it to a closed-loop and make our traffic system smart using an ultrasonic sensor.


# Working :

   Whenever the vehicle comes into the range of an ultrasonic sensor, According to the path, the loop opens  
For example: when a car is coming into the range of ultrasonic sensor in path 1, the path 1 will be opened .If 3 paths are full of vehicles, then each loop will be opened and closed with a short delay .As usual, if traffic is less, then in which path the vehicle is there, that path will be opened 

  Here I have attached the demo link of project  to see how it works : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UJUG30rqCvx_tDSVQcPrJ7ABdxu2lkvU?usp=sharing
